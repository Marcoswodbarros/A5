## Tips

### To use the App you'll have to perform the following steps:

- Clone the repository: git clone (https://github.com/Marcoswodbarros/A5)
- Access the project folder: cd a5-challenge
- Access the backend folder: cd api
- Install the backend dependencies: npm install express cors body-parser
- Start the backend: node server.js
- Access the project folder: cd a5-challenge
- Start the frontend (in a different terminal): npm start



## My process

### Built with

- React
- JavaScript
- CSS
- Fetch API
- REST API
- Node
- Express
- JSON
- Git
  

### What I learned

While I was building this project, I could work again with some nice tecnologies, like: React, JS, Node and Express. One of them (Express) I was using for the first time.
It was a challenging project for which I needed to do a lot of research and understand the integration of the backend with the frontend.


### Continued development

The idea is to be hired by A5 Solutions, improve my React and Backend knowledge and also help others people showing them different kind of ways to code.
